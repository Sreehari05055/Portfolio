            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Employee Management System is a robust Windows Forms application built using C# and integrated with a SQL Server database. It is designed to streamline the process of managing employee information, work schedules, payroll, and attendance. This project showcases my proficiency in object-oriented programming, database management, and GUI application development.

        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            One of the major challenges was implementing a scalable clock-in/clock-out system. I designed a reliable system that tracks time and handles scenarios with seamless data storage in SQL Server. Additionally, ensuring real-time payroll updates required optimizing SQL queries for performance efficiency.

        <h2>Further Updates</h2>
        <p>
          One of the key updates I plan to implement in the future is a tax deduction method. However, due to the complexity of the calculations involved, I am unable to incorporate it at this time.
