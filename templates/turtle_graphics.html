            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The GraphicSystem is a Java-based graphical application that builds on the OOPGraphics framework to provide an interactive canvas for drawing and manipulating shapes. The system allows users to issue commands that control a virtual drawing tool, similar to a turtle graphics system, providing functionalities to create various geometric figures and manipulate the drawing environment.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> The application uses Java's JFrame to create a window where the user can interact with the drawing canvas. This GUI provides real-time visual feedback as users issue commands.</li>
            <li><strong>Command Processing:</strong> The system can process multiple commands through its processCommand method. The available commands include:<br>
                            Movement commands: turnleft, turnright, forward, backward<br>
                            Shape commands: square, triangle, righttriangle, mandala<br>
                            Customization commands: penwidth, pencolour, bgc (background color)<br>
                            Utility commands: clear to clear the canvas, save to save the canvas as an image, and load to load an existing image.<br></li>
            <li><strong>Saving and Loading:</strong> Users can save their current canvas to a file in an image format using the saveImg() method. They can also save drawing commands to a text file for later execution using the toWrite() method.
                                                     The system offers a prompt to save the canvas before clearing it. The load command allows users to reload previously saved images.<br></li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling and User Interaction:</strong>The system ensures user interaction through dialog boxes for confirmations (e.g., before clearing the canvas) and prompts for file names when saving the canvas.
                                                                     It includes exception handling for input errors or failed operations, ensuring a smooth user experience.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="technology">
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Java</li>
    <li><strong>Framework:</strong> Java Swing for GUI</li>
    <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), javax.imageio for image processing</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Framework:</strong> OOPGraphics (extends built-in capabilities for graphical commands)</li>
    <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> BufferedImage, FileWriter, ImageIO for saving/loading images and commands</li>
</ul>
    </section>

   <section class="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        A major challenge was implementing the save and load functionality for the drawing canvas. Initially, managing image data and command history in an efficient and user-friendly way was difficult. I overcame this by utilizing `BufferedImage` and `FileWriter` for image saving and command logging, ensuring integration between the graphical interface and file handling.
